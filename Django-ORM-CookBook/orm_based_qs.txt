from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.db import models

class CUser(User):
    score = models.IntegerField()

The custom user has an additional field (score), we want to do the following operations using ORM queries only. Every answer must have a single query:

1.Calculate the mean score of all users.(average)
2.Find the user with the highest score.
3.Find if there is any user with score less than 2 (return True/False)
4.Find all the users which have score exactly equal to the mean score.
5.Change the score value of all users in a single query to 100 (one hundred)
6.Find all the users which don't have score 10 or 20
7.Print a list of all the score values from all users excluding the first 10 users.

Answers:
1 Cuser.objects.all().aggregate(Avg('score'))
2 Cuser.objects.all().aggregate(Max('sccore'))
	Cuser.objects.all().order_by('-score')[0]
3 Cuser.objects.filter(score__lt=2).exists()
4 
5 
6 Cuser.objects.filter(~Q(score__in = 10) | ~Q(score__in=20))
7 Cuser.objects.filter(score__gt=10)
